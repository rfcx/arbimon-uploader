## Getting started

### Requirements

- Node 8.11.0+

### Start development environment

1. Install dependencies

    ``` bash
    npm install
    ```

2. Start the electron browser/app with hot reload (auto restarts app on file changes)

    ``` bash
    npm run dev
    ```

### Build

Build electron application for production

## Build a notarized version of the app on Mac

1. Get a certificate (.pem) with the password (.p12) from DevOps or Team Lead. Check the certificate in the Keychain: Developer ID Application: Rainforest Connection with the private key. (see the example: https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/dev97211aeac).
2. Go to https://appleid.apple.com/account/manage for creating your APP-SPECIFIC PASSWORDS for the Ingest App.
3. Add to the local env the following:
export appleId=**YOUR-APPLE-ID**
export appleIdPassword=**APP-SPECIFIC PASSWORD**
4. Use ```npm run build``` command for building the app.

## Build the app on Windows

1. Get a certificate with the password from DevOps or Team Lead.
Add this information to your package.json of the app:
``` bash
    ‚Äúwin‚Äù: {
        ‚ÄúcertificateFile‚Äù: ‚Äú./build/certs/######.p12‚Äù,
        ‚ÄúcertificatePassword‚Äù: ‚Äú######‚Äù
    }
```
2. Paste static files from the previous build into `./node-server/public`. After every build, we should put 4 files with the last version in the folder: `./node-server/public` and includes following files: RELEASES, .exe, *-delta.nupkg and -full.nupkg (If a new version of the app v1.1.1 you should put v1.1.0 to the folder).
3. Run ```npm run start``` in `./node-server` to start serving those static files from the previous build.
3. Check you Node.js port  to the package.json of the app:
``` bash
    ‚ÄúsquirrelWindows‚Äù: {
        ‚ÄúremoteReleases‚Äù: ‚Äúhttp://localhost:5000/public‚Äù
    }
```
4. Use ```npm run build``` command for building the app in another terminal.
5. After building we you see two folders for windows in the `./app/build` folder:
    - squirrel windows
    - squirrel-windows-ia32
These folders keep a new release for WinX64 and WinX86.
6. Upload assets for releases to the GitHub: __RELEASES, .exe, *-delta.nupkg and -full.nupkg__.
For supporting the WinX86 system we should only publish one version for the 32-bit system. Both assets files (ia32, x64) have similar names, but the 32-bit system doesn‚Äôt support a 64-bit system.

## Build Windows on Mac
1. Install required library (ffprobe) that needed on Windows by running ```npm install --force```
2. Make sure the `@ffprobe-installer` folder in `node_modules` has got the Windows related folders: `win32-ia32` `win32-x64`
3. Follow steps in "Build the app on Windows" above, but use ```npm run build:win``` instead of normal ```npm run build``` in #4 step.

## Linting

Lint all JS/Vue component files in `src/`
``` bash
npm run lint
```

## Project structure
In electron, there are 2 processes: main & renderer. Both processes are stored in `src` folder.

## Renderer process
With electron-vue, we are using vue components to make our large complex applications more organization. Each component has the ability to encapsulate its own CSS, template, and JavaScript functionality. Components are stored in `src/renderer/components`.

## Main process
`src/main/index.js` file is the app‚Äôs main file, the file in which electron boots with.
