## Project structure
In electron, there are 2 processes: main & renderer. Both processes are stored in `src` folder.

### Renderer process
With electron-vue, we are using vue components to make our large complex applications more organization. Each component has the ability to encapsulate its own CSS, template, and JavaScript functionality. Components are stored in `src/renderer/components`. 

In this project, there are 2 components for UI, and 2 other components for services.
- Landing page (UI)
- Add stream page (UI)
- FS Service (Service)
- API Service (Service)

### Main process
`src/main/index.js` file is the app‚Äôs main file, the file in which electron boots with. There are 3 windows running in this project:
- `mainWindow` for the UI components, starting with the landing page
- `backgroundFSWindow` to watch files change in the directory
- `backgroundAPIWindow` to queue and upload the files to the RFCx platform
